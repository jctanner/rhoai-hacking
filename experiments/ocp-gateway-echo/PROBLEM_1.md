# Gateway API Issue on OpenShift CRC

## Problem Statement
The echo app and the gateway are deployed, but the gateway's programmed state is stuck in "Unknown"

```
$ oc get gateway -A
NAMESPACE   NAME           CLASS               ADDRESS   PROGRAMMED   AGE
echo-test   echo-gateway   openshift-gateway             Unknown      13m
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Diagnostic Results:

1. **‚úÖ Gateway API CRDs are installed**
   ```
   $ oc get crd | grep gateway
   gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io                          2025-06-15T12:53:15Z
   gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io                                2025-06-15T12:53:15Z

   ```

2. **‚ùå No GatewayClasses available** (INITIALLY)
   ```
   $ oc get gatewayclass
   No resources found
   ```

3. **‚ùå No Gateway controller running**
   ```
   $ oc get pods -A | grep -i gateway
   (no results)
   ```

### DEPLOY_ALL.sh Bug Discovery:
The script references `gatewayClassName: openshift-gateway` but **never creates this GatewayClass**!

### Experiment Results:
After manually creating the missing GatewayClass:
```bash
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: openshift-gateway
spec:
  controllerName: openshift.io/gateway-controller
EOF
```

Gateway status changed from "Unknown" to showing internal conditions as "Pending", but still shows "PROGRAMMED: Unknown" because there's no actual controller running.

### Root Cause
OpenShift CRC has the **Gateway API CRDs installed but no actual Gateway controller or GatewayClass configured**. This means:
- The Gateway resource can be created (CRDs exist)
- But nothing is processing or managing the Gateway (no controller)
- The `openshift-gateway` GatewayClass referenced in our configuration doesn't exist

### Why This Happens
OpenShift CRC ships with Gateway API CRDs for compatibility, but doesn't include a Gateway controller by default. Gateway API requires a separate implementation/controller (like Istio, Envoy Gateway, etc.) to actually function.

## Potential Solutions

### Option A: Use OpenShift Routes (Recommended)
Switch to using native OpenShift Routes instead of Gateway API, which are fully supported in CRC and simpler for local development.

### Option B: Install a Gateway Controller
Install a Gateway API implementation like:
- Istio Service Mesh
- Envoy Gateway
- Another Gateway API controller

For a simple echo server test, **Option A is recommended** as it's much simpler and natively supported.

## Configuration Issue
Additionally, there's a port mismatch in the current configuration:
- CONTEXT_echo_app.md shows port 5678 (correct default for hashicorp/http-echo)
- DEPLOY_ALL.sh uses port 8080
- This needs to be fixed regardless of the Gateway API vs Route choice

## Update: Service Mesh 3.0 Control Plane Deployed

**Date**: Current session
**Action**: Deployed Service Mesh 3.0 control plane via OpenShift Console
- ‚úÖ **Service Mesh 3.0 Operator** was already installed
- ‚úÖ **IstioCNI** configured via Installed Operators page  
- ‚úÖ **Istio** control plane configured via Installed Operators page
- üîÑ **Status**: Need to verify if GatewayClass is now available and functional

**Next Steps**:
1. Check if `openshift-gateway` GatewayClass now exists
2. Verify if Gateway resources are now being processed
3. Test actual Gateway functionality with the echo app

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM RESOLVED: PROGRAMMED: Unknown ‚Üí False

**Date**: Current session
**Action**: Deployed with revised DEPLOY_ALL.sh and Service Mesh 3.0

### **üéâ Original Problem Solved:**
The original issue of `PROGRAMMED: Unknown` has been **completely resolved**:

**Before (Original Problem):**
```bash
NAMESPACE   NAME           CLASS               ADDRESS   PROGRAMMED   AGE
echo-test   echo-gateway   openshift-gateway             Unknown      13m
```

**After (Service Mesh 3.0 + Revised DEPLOY_ALL.sh):**
```bash
NAMESPACE   NAME           CLASS   ADDRESS   PROGRAMMED   AGE
echo-test   echo-gateway   istio             False        2m3s
```

### **‚úÖ What Was Fixed:**
1. **GatewayClass Available**: `istio` GatewayClass now exists and is functional
2. **Gateway Controller Working**: Istio is processing Gateway resources
3. **Status Progression**: `Unknown` ‚Üí `False` means the controller is working
4. **Resource Creation**: All Gateway API resources are properly created

### **üîç Current State Analysis:**
- **‚úÖ Gateway Accepted**: `status.conditions.type: Accepted = True`
- **‚ùå Gateway Not Programmed**: `status.conditions.type: Programmed = False`
- **Reason**: `AddressNotAssigned` - LoadBalancer service cannot get external IP
- **Message**: "address pending for hostname echo-gateway-istio.echo-test.svc.cluster.local"

### **üéØ Key Insight:**
`PROGRAMMED: False` is **much better than Unknown** because:
- **Unknown**: No controller processing the Gateway
- **False**: Controller working but blocked by infrastructure limitation

### **üìã Resolution Summary:**
1. **‚úÖ Installed Service Mesh 3.0** - Provides Gateway API controller
2. **‚úÖ Revised DEPLOY_ALL.sh** - Fixed port configurations and added validation
3. **‚úÖ Smart GatewayClass Detection** - Automatically uses available `istio` GatewayClass
4. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing** - Validates deployment and shows exact status

### **üöÄ Next Challenge:**
The **original Gateway API problem is solved**. The remaining issue is the **LoadBalancer limitation** on CRC - which is exactly what **TinyLB** is designed to address.
