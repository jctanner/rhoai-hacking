#### **2. Router → Istio Gateway (Internal)**
| **Component** | **Status** | **Configuration** |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenShift Routes** | 🔓 **No TLS** | `TERMINATION: None` |
| **Route Backend** | 🔓 **HTTP Only** | Port 80 only |

2. **Certificate Management**: No dedicated certificate management for Gateway API

### **Low Risk Issues (Mitigated)**
1. **✅ Traffic Interception**: Internal traffic now encrypted with mTLS
2. **✅ Man-in-the-Middle**: Certificate validation enforced for service mesh
3. **✅ Identity Verification**: Services authenticate each other via mTLS
4. **✅ HTTPS Access**: Users can access application securely via router TLS

### **Configuration Gaps (Remaining)**
1. **No Gateway HTTPS**: Gateway has no HTTPS listener (Layer 3 target)
2. **Certificate Management**: No automated certificate management for Gateway API

## 🛠️ **Solution Analysis**

### **Layer 1: OpenShift Router TLS ✅ COMPLETED**

#### **Problem**: HTTPS requests fail with 503 errors ✅ SOLVED

  -p='{"spec":{"tls":{"termination":"edge","insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy":"Redirect"}}}'
```

**✅ Achieved Result**: HTTPS traffic terminates at router, HTTP to backend, automatic redirect working

### **Layer 2: Service Mesh mTLS ✅ COMPLETED**

spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
EOF
```

**✅ Achieved Result**: All service-to-service traffic encrypted with mTLS, echo pod has 2/2 containers

### **Layer 3: Gateway API HTTPS ✅ COMPLETED**

#### **Problem**: Gateway configured for HTTP only ✅ SOLVED
#### **Root Cause**: No HTTPS listener in Gateway specification ✅ IDENTIFIED
#### **Solution**: Add HTTPS listener to Gateway ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### **🔍 Certificate Requirements Discovery**

**Important Finding**: OpenShift's Gateway API implementation **does NOT automatically provision TLS certificates** unlike OpenShift Router which provides automatic `*.apps-crc.testing` certificates.

**Gateway API TLS Requirements:**
- **`mode: "Terminate"`**: Requires explicit `certificateRefs` to Kubernetes TLS secrets
- **`mode: "Passthrough"`**: Passes TLS through without terminating (doesn't need certs)

**Certificate Options Investigation:**
```bash
# ❌ No automatic certificate provisioning
oc explain gateway.spec.listeners.tls
# Returns: "certificateRefs field is required when mode is set to 'Terminate'"

# ❌ No default TLS certificates in Istio namespace
oc get secrets -n istio-system | grep -E "(tls|cert)"
# Returns: No certificate-related secrets found

# ✅ OpenShift Router provides automatic certificates
oc get routes -n echo-test -o yaml | grep -A 5 "tls:"
# Returns: termination: edge (automatic certificate provisioning)
```

**Implementation Options for Layer 3:**

1. **Option 1: Self-Signed Certificate (Development)**
   ```bash
   # Create self-signed certificate for Gateway API
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout gateway-key.pem -out gateway-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=echo.apps-crc.testing"
   oc create secret tls echo-tls-cert --cert=gateway-cert.pem --key=gateway-key.pem -n echo-test
   ```

2. **Option 2: Istio Automatic Certificate Options (Investigation)**
   ```bash
   # Test Istio-specific certificate options
   oc patch gateway echo-gateway -n echo-test --type='json' -p='[{
     "op": "add",
     "path": "/spec/listeners/-",
     "value": {
       "name": "https",
       "port": 443,
       "protocol": "HTTPS",
       "hostname": "echo.apps-crc.testing",
       "tls": {
         "mode": "Terminate",
         "options": {
           "istio.io/auto-certificate": "true"
         }
       }
     }
   }]'
   ```

3. **Option 3: Certificate Manager Integration (Production)**
   ```bash
   # Install cert-manager for automatic certificate management
   # Configure Let's Encrypt or internal CA for certificate provisioning
   ```

**Proposed Gateway Configuration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: echo-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    hostname: echo.apps-crc.testing
  - name: https          # ← Add HTTPS listener
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    hostname: echo.apps-crc.testing
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:      # ← Required for Terminate mode
      - name: echo-tls-cert # ← Must be manually created
```

#### **✅ Layer 3 Implementation Completed:**
```bash
# ✅ COMPLETED: Create self-signed certificate for Gateway API
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout gateway-key.pem -out gateway-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=echo.apps-crc.testing"

# ✅ COMPLETED: Create Kubernetes TLS secret
oc create secret tls echo-tls-cert --cert=gateway-cert.pem --key=gateway-key.pem -n echo-test

# ✅ COMPLETED: Add HTTPS listener to Gateway with certificate reference
oc patch gateway echo-gateway -n echo-test --type='json' -p='[{
  "op": "add",
  "path": "/spec/listeners/-",
  "value": {
    "name": "https",
    "port": 443,
    "protocol": "HTTPS",
    "hostname": "echo.apps-crc.testing",
    "tls": {
      "mode": "Terminate",
      "certificateRefs": [
        {
          "name": "echo-tls-cert"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}]'

# ✅ COMPLETED: Switch route to passthrough mode for native Gateway API TLS
oc patch route echo-gateway-route -n echo-test --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"tls":{"termination":"passthrough","insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy":null}}}'

# ✅ COMPLETED: Update route to point to HTTPS port
oc patch route echo-gateway-route -n echo-test --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"port":{"targetPort":"443"}}}'
```
