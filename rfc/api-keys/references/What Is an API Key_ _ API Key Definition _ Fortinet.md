Understand why API keys are used, how they provide security, and when not
to use them.

An application programming interface �API� key is a code
used to identify and authenticate an application or user. API
keys are available through platforms, such as a whitelabeled internal marketplace. They also act as a unique
identifier and provide a secret token for authentication
purposes.
APIs are interfaces that help build software and define how
pieces of software interact with each other. They control
requests made between programs, how those requests are
made, and the data formats used. They are commonly used

on Internet-of-Things �IoT� applications and websites to
gather and process data or enable users to input
information. For example, users can get a Google API key or
YouTube API keys, which are accessible through an API key
generator.
An API key is passed by an application, which then calls the
API to identify the user, developer, or program attempting
to access a website. It can help break development silos
and will typically be accompanied by a set of access rights
that belong to the API the key is associated with.

API keys are commonly used to control the utilization of the
API’s interface and track how it is being used. This is often
as a precaution to prevent abuse or malicious use. Common
reasons why to use API keys include:

API keys are used in projects, providing authentication to
identify users and the project itself. API keys provide
project authorization through:

API keys can be used to identify a specific project or the
application making the call to the API. While API keys are
not as secure as the tokens that provide authentication,
they help identify the project or application that makes the
call. This ensures they can also be used to designate usage
information to a specific project and reject unauthorized
access requests.

API keys are commonly used to check that the application
making the call to the API has access to do so.
Authorization will also check that the API being used in the
project is enabled.

Authentication schemes are used to identify the caller
requesting API access. Endpoints or devices can check the
authentication token to confirm the user has permission to
make the call, while the API server can use authentication
token information to make a decision on whether to
authorize a request.
API keys can be used for the following authentication
purposes:

This verifies that the person making the call is the person
they claim to be by checking or authenticating the identity
of the user.

This checks whether the user making the call has
permission to make the kind of request they have issued.

is increasingly important, especially given the
rapid rise in IoT usage. APIs transmit sensitive user data
between the applications and systems they access and
interact with. Therefore, an insecure API could be a highvalue and easy target for attackers to obtain critical data
and gain unauthorized access to computers and networks.

There are several common usages for API keys, including:

Anonymous traffic can be an indicator of potentially
malicious activity or traffic. API keys can identify application
traffic, which can be used to debug issues or analyze
application usage.

Controlling the number of calls made to an API helps to
govern API consumption, limit traffic and usage, and ensure
only legitimate traffic accesses the API.

Identifying usage patterns is crucial to spotting malicious
activity or issues within the API.

Activity on the API server can be logged as a series of
events, which can be filtered by the specific API key.

API keys cannot be used for the following purposes:

API keys cannot be used for secure authorization because
they are not as secure as authentication tokens. Instead,
they identify an application or project that calls an API.

API keys are generated by the project making a call but
cannot be used to identify who created the project.

API keys are used to identity projects, not the individual
users that access a project.
